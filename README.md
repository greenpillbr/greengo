## Application Prototype

We designed the whole app on the [Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/gH29KHbhaFi7ki19vWQItS/GreenGo-%5BMobile-App%5D?node-id=0-1&t=gbaPMeEwLenhSKle-1) here is the App and here it's the [Prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/gH29KHbhaFi7ki19vWQItS/GreenGo-Mobile-App?node-id=0-1&p=f&viewport=2396%2C-7%2C0.09&t=gbaPMeEwLenhSKle-0&scaling=scale-down&content-scaling=fixed&starting-point-node-id=6%3A2&show-proto-sidebar=1).

## Purpose

## ðŸŒ± Development Roadmap

With support from this dApps and Apps grant, weâ€™ll develop and validate our MVP over 4 months, focusing on real impact, usability, and fun â€” built in clear, iterative phases.

---

### ðŸŸ¢ Phase 1 â€“ Educational Onboarding

- Interactive onboarding screens explaining how the app works
- Login via email and Web3 wallets (using Privy)
- Supabase integration for user authentication

ðŸŽ¯ **Goal**: Make the mission of GreenGo clear from the first contact and onboard users effectively.

---

## ðŸŸ¡ Phase 2 â€“ Issue Submission Flow

- Submit real-world issues via form with geolocation
- Categories: trash, lost animals, hunger/food insecurity
- Photo upload, description and location metadata
- Storage and visibility on backend (Supabase)

ðŸŽ¯ **Goal**: Enable users to easily report issues happening in their area.

---

## ðŸŸ  Phase 3 â€“ Explore Nearby Issues

- Map with pins showing reported issues
- Filters by category and distance
- Map integration using Leaflet or Mapbox

ðŸŽ¯ **Goal**: Let users discover missions nearby and choose how to take action.

---

## ðŸŸ£ Phase 4 â€“ Submit Resolutions + Get Rewards

- Submit proof of action (cleaning, helping a pet, donating food)
- Upload photos/videos/testimonials
- Manual or community-based validation
- Rewards in XP and symbolic points (tokens in future phase)

ðŸŽ¯ **Goal**: Incentivize real-world action with recognition and gamified feedback.

---

## ðŸ”µ Phase 5 â€“ Profile, XP, and Badges

- Profile page with user history and actions
- XP system based on completed missions
- Unlockable badges by impact type and quantity
- Public visibility of positive contributions

ðŸŽ¯ **Goal**: Create a strong sense of progress, achievement, and social impact.

---

## ðŸŸ¤ Phase 6 â€“ Guilds and Leagues (Post-Validation Expansion)

- Create guilds (by neighborhood, cause, or affinity group)
- Rankings between guilds based on collective impact
- Seasonal leagues with challenges and rewards
- Display guilds on map and in public feed

ðŸŽ¯ **Goal**: Make the game more fun, social, and viral â€” encouraging collective civic action.

## ðŸ§¾ Resource Allocation

| Area            | Allocation | Team Members                            |
|-----------------|------------|-----------------------------------------|

| Operations      | 30%        | 2 People (Community, UX, Partnerships)  |
